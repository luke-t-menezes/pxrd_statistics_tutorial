        "\n",
        "For this demo, we will cover the statistics commonly used to assess the goodness-of-fit of X-ray diffraction experimental data to theoretical models. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) is a powerful and convenient technique for determining the composition and atomic structure of crystalline materials. A simple PXRD experiment involves bombarding a powder sample with X-rays (typically Cu Kα radiation in a lab setting) and detecting the angles at which X-rays are scattered off the sample. Since the diffraction condition relies upon the charcateristic lattice spacing in a crystalline material, the identity of the components of the sample may be identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rietveld refinements are widely used in solid-state chemistry and materials science to determine sample composition from PXRD data. A popular software package for performing Rietveld refinements is GSAS-II (https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/). All Rietveld refinements start with a structural model of the material you believe to be in your sample, or one that is similar enough to the material in your sample. The process of refining involves making adjustments to your starting model such that it's simulated PXRD pattern resembles the experimental pattern more and more with each successive step. **The goal of the Rietveld refinementis to minimize the difference between the simulated PXRD pattern based on your structural model and your experimental diffraction pattern.**\n",
        "\n",
        "We won't be using GSAS-II directly in this demo; that is beyond the scope of this tutorial. Rather, we will be looking at the goodness-of-fit metrics throughout different stages of a refinement. When reporting the results of Rietveld refinements the metrics that we care about are the residual factor(*R*) and χ<sup>2</sup> (pronounced chi-squared). Both or these metrics tell us about the cumulative difference in the simulated and experimental intensity data. Poor fits (the simulated pattern doesn't align with the experimental pattern at all) correspond to large *R* and χ<sup>2</sup> values."
